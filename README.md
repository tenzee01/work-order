# Work Order Interface  

Our project aims to address the issue of the inaccessibility of Wellesley's work orders website for students. Currently, the platform lacks a cohesive way to submit work orders and does not support access from mobile devices. This creates significant challenges for students, particularly in urgent situations such as dorm heating issues in cold MA winters.  We will develop an intuitive Wellesley work orders webpage with CSS, and HTML. The platform will offer effective communication with maintenance staff and will be accessible on both mobile devices and PCs.
